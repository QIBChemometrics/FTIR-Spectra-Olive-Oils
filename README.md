# FTIR-Spectra-Olive-Oils
The file "FTIR_Spectra_olive_oils.csv" contains a collection of 120 FTIR (mid-infrared) spectra collected in duplicate from 60 different authenticated extra virgin olive oils from different geographic regions. These were supplied to the Quadram Institute Bioscience (formerly the Institute of Food Research, UK) by the International Olive Oil Council.

The data are described in full in the journal paper "FTIR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis can distinguish the geographic origin of extra virgin olive oils" (Tapp H.S. et al, J. Agric. Food Chem. 51 (21) 6110-5 (2003)).
